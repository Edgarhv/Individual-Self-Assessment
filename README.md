It was difficult to make this project, but at first, each team member chose a shape, and We knew that each shape was responsible for a specific task. Also, We chose from the square, circle, triangle, and X. Finally, We chose a figure concerning our strengths and with the help of the documentation on canvas.

We created a page where we can edit code all together at the same time and this is how we started to work. Also, with the help of other technologies such as WhatsApp we have and create good communication. https://deepnote.com/project/Untitled-Python-Project-eAGO52SQT5SsuFcbuPwvtw/%2FUntitled.ipynb

## Advantages 
* Working together facilitates idea generation and creativity
* Teamwork improves productivity
* It was a motivation 
* When we work together, we learn faster
## Disadvantages
* we were just two people working
* Lazy team member
* It takes more time
* It takes more time working and the organization

# Project
Predicting the Market Value of Football Players

We used a multiple linear regression analysis to make predictions about the data but it can also help us to identify the variables which have a significant effect on the dependent variable (market_value). For this reason, this approach was both suitable and reasonable for us to use here.

## Variables

Club Market Value
Red Cards
Assists
Age
Hours Played
Goals
Transfer Fee
Games
Yellow Cards
Player Position

Dependent Variable :Market value

### DV= β + β1 A + β2 Pp + β3 G + β4 G + β5 A + β6 Hp + β7 Yc + β8 Rc + β9Tf + β10 Cmv + є

### Results

-We can see that R-squared is equal to 0.691, which means that the regression equation can explain the 69.1% variation in player value.

After that , and to improve our project we used a library called Py Caret that helped us find the best possible model for the data. Finally, we used the Extra Tree Regression Model that gives us  R2 of 0.732

## Future Iterations
* Incorporate new data

* Divide the data by clusters  (e.g. player position)

* Run the model for a more recent season and compare the results.
