# Project
Predicting the Market Value of Football Players

We used a multiple linear regression analysis to make predictions about the data but it can also help us to identify the variables which have a significant effect on the dependent variable (market_value). For this reason, this approach was both suitable and reasonable for us to use here.

## Variables

Club Market Value
Red Cards
Assists
Age
Hours Played
Goals
Transfer Fee
Games
Yellow Cards
Player Position

Dependent Variable :Market value

### DV= β + β1 A + β2 Pp + β3 G + β4 G + β5 A + β6 Hp + β7 Yc + β8 Rc + β9Tf + β10 Cmv + є

### Results

-We can see that R-squared is equal to 0.691, which means that the regression equation can explain the 69.1% variation in player value.

After that , and to improve our project we used a library called Py Caret that helped us find the best possible model for the data. Finally, we used the Extra Tree Regression Model that gives us  R2 of 0.732
